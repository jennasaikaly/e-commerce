  # E-Commerce Back End  

  ## Description

  This is the challenge for Module 13 where we are tasked with creating the backend for an e-commerce site.  I used the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect an existing Express.js API to a MySQL database.  I also used the dotenv package so that I could use environment variables to store my sensitive MySQL data (username, password, database name).

  ## Installation

  To install this project, the user will need to clone the repository and then use 'npm install' to download the dependencies into the node_modules folder.

  ## Usage 

  Once the application has been installed, the user needs to first use the MySQL command line to run the schema command (source db/schema.sql) and then 'quit' to leave MySql.  Next, the user needs to run the seed command using 'npm run seed' and then 'npm start' to start the server.  Once this has been done, the user can test the the routes in a program like Insomnia.
